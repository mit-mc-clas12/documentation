# Release Cycle:


- edit indexMaintanance.php with new message, push it to repo
- on repo, run testRelease.sh from /group/clas12/SubMit/utils/scripts. This will:

	- clone/pull repos to test dir in /group/clas/www/gemc/html
	- clone/pull repos to test dir in /group/clas12/SubMit/
	- copy indexMaintanance.php to index.php
	- copy stats files into test dir
	- copy sql permissions files into test dir
	- update permission so gemc user can write on the various dirs

At this point submitting jobs will:

	- write the scard in /u/group/clas/www/gemc/html/test/web_interface


- after tests: uncomment Maintanance completed in index.php and run updateSubmit.sh. this is the  "official release". Change this to run installRelease with argument.
