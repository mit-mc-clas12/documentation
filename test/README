- cd /group/clas/www/gemc/html and run testRelease.sh to:

	- clone repos  inside a "test" directories on /group/clas/www/gemc/html and /group/clas12/SubMit/
	- copy indexMaintanance.php to index.php
	- copy stats files into test dir
	- copy permissions files into test dir
	- update permission so gemc can write on the various dirs

- If mysql table are changed:

	- alter table CLAS12OCR.submissions auto_increment = 220;
	- copy users tables into new one

- change osgQuery or use the test version to pick up the correct directory. Change to: use osgQuery test, or give optional arguments?

8. update    gemcSubmitCron.sh (or create gemcSubmitCronTest.sh)  	cd /group/clas12/SubMit/test/SubMit/server - or give optional arguments?

- after tests: uncomment Maintanance completed in index.php and run updateSubmit.sh. this is the  "official release". Change this to run installRelease with argument.
