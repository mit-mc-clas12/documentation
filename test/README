# Test Server:

https://gemc.jlab.org/test/web_interface/index.php

- The server should be accessible to OSG team only.
- It mimics the production server, but using another database.
- It can have extra infos useful for debugging the production or the test DB



## Locations:

/group/clas/www/gemc/html/test/web_interface

Subdirs:
- web_interface
- SubMit/client
- SubMit/utils


/group/clas12/SubMit/test
Subdirs:
- SubMit/server
- SubMit/utils



	TODO:
	- run Submit.py to upload the new entry to the test DB.
	- modify gemcSubmitCron script (option parameter), reading from test DB, to submit to OSG



# Complete Release Cycle:


- edit indexMaintanance.php with new message, push it to repo
- on repo, run testRelease.sh from /group/clas12/SubMit/utils/shScripts. This will:


	- clone/pull repos to test dir in /group/clas/www/gemc/html
	- clone/pull repos to test dir in /group/clas12/SubMit/
	- copy indexMaintanance.php to index.php
	- copy stats files into test dir
	- copy sql permissions files into test dir
	- update permission so gemc user can write on the various dirs



At this point submitting jobs will:

	- write the scard in /u/group/clas/www/gemc/html/test/web_interface


- after tests: uncomment Maintanance completed in index.php and run updateSubmit.sh. this is the  "official release". Change this to run installRelease with argument.



# Tips:


- If mysql table are changed:

	- mysql backup
	- alter table CLAS12OCR.submissions auto_increment = 220;
	- copy users tables into new one



- after tests: uncomment Maintanance completed in index.php and run updateSubmit.sh. this is the  "official release". Change this to run installRelease with argument.
