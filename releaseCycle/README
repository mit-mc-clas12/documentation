# Tips:


- If mysql table are changed:

	- mysql backup
	- alter table CLAS12OCR.submissions auto_increment = 220;
	- copy users tables into new one



- after tests: uncomment Maintanance completed in index.php and run updateSubmit.sh. this is the  "official release". Change this to run installRelease with argument.


- To submit we need the modified msql_conn_test.txt:

cp /home/gemc/software/Submit/msql_conn.txt /home/gemc/software/Submittest/SubMit/msql_conn_test.txt
cd /home/gemc/software/Submit/test/SubMit/
sed -i s/CLAS12OCR/CLAS12TEST/ msql_conn_test.txt
