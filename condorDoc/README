Special flags to condor

Requirements = (HAS_SINGULARITY =?= TRUE) && (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org=?=True) && (OSG_HOST_KERNEL_VERSION >= 21700) && (CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org_REVISION >= 16688)

CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org_REVISION: Nathan: some website suggest using the attr command on the submit node


For a 12 hour timeout - I would only implement this if you have codes which are getting stuck and will not finish by it self.
You can do it with a periodic hold expression. For example:

PeriodicHold = (JobStatus == 2) && (time() - EnteredCurrentStatus) > (12 * 60 * 60)




Useful commands:
---------------------


condor status to see jobs pilots destination:

condor_status -af GLIDEIN_SITE | sort | uniq -c


total for the different Run Projects
condor_q -name scosg16.jlab.org -af ProjectName -const 'JobStatus=?=2' | sort | uniq -c
   3375 CLAS12
   2354 GLUEX


To extend timeout:

set _CONDOR_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=100
before running condor_q or any condor commands



To make sure we get enough disk space:

as gemc on scosg16 condor_qedit -const 'RequestDisk=?=1' RequestDisk 1000000

One kb means the job says “I need 1 kb” and the node says okay I got that.
Then either the job begins transferring more than 1 kb or produces more than 1 kb and the node goes: “stop it you dirty liar job…..I’m evicting you!”.
The job goes “oh okay…..so anybody have 1 kb of disk space for me” *cue a clamor of yeses*




change requirement

condor_qedit -const 'OSG_GLIDEIN_VERSION >= 546' 'OSG_GLIDEIN_VERSION >= 534'

To submit a job:

* condor_submit file.condor

Query jobs:

* condor_q
* condor_q -goodput
* condor_q -better-analyze JOBID
* condor_q  -hold

User History:

* condor_history mauri
* condor_history -long mauri

Useful Commands:
* condor_rm ID


* Condor Hold:
condor_hold -constraint 'ClusterId == N && ProcId >= 5000'
You can also "test" the constraint with condor_q first. condor_q and
condor_hold takes the same -const argument.
