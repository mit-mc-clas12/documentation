condor status to see jobs pilots destination:

condor_status -af GLIDEIN_SITE | sort | uniq -c


total for the different Run Projects
condor_q -name scosg16.jlab.org -af ProjectName -const 'JobStatus=?=2' | sort | uniq -c
   3375 CLAS12
   2354 GLUEX


To extend timeout:

set _CONDOR_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=100
before running condor_q or any condor commands



To make sure we get enough disk space:

as gemc on scosg16 condor_qedit -const 'RequestDisk=?=1' RequestDisk 1000000

One kb means the job says “I need 1 kb” and the node says okay I got that.
Then either the job begins transferring more than 1 kb or produces more than 1 kb and the node goes: “stop it you dirty liar job…..I’m evicting you!”.
The job goes “oh okay…..so anybody have 1 kb of disk space for me” *cue a clamor of yeses*
